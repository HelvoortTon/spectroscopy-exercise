# spectroscopy-channel-calibration

Made by Brynjar Morka MÃ¦hlum for the subject TFY4255, as a part of Brynjars "TFY4520 Nanoteknologi, fordypningsprosjekt".

## Goal of this notebook:

**Use a spectrum with at least two known peaks to calibrate the channel width of a detector, and then use the calibration to plot an unknown spectrum.**

To calibrate a spectrum we calculate:

- dispersion [keV / channel], which is the width of each channel
- offset [channels], which is the distance from first data entry to keV=0

When we have calibrated a spectrum, we could also find:

- energy resolution
- quantities of each element by area under the peak
  - bear in mind: this is dependent on signal-to-background, efficiency of the detector, ...
- ... ?

### What we will do:

1. Read in the data of a known spectrum
2. Fit the data to a gaussian
3. Calibrate the x-axis
4. Plot the calibrated data
5. Use the calibrated x-axis on an unknown spectrum from the same source

### Organisation of the repository

This is the file tree:

**insert file tree**

The main notebook is called "channel_calibration.ipynb", which contains a step-by-step calibration of a known spectrum, and then using that on an unknown spectrum.

To make the notebooks shorter and more understandable, I've made the folder "helper_files" with functions that you will use. The helper functions are documented with NumPy docstrings, which you can read by running a cell with the function name followed by a questionmark:

```python
function_name?
```

```
>>> prints the docstring of function_name
```

### Challenges I've had

- What is the actual zero / start of the data?
  - What to do with the zero-peak which some instruments have?
  - Some (or all?) spectra starts measuring before 0. How do I set the 0 right?
- Some datasets (eg. .emsa of GaAs_30keV) starts with negative keV values.
- Not possible to recognize all peaks, since some are low.
  - Without bg removal one peak is usually fitted in the middle as the bg with a very high std
- For some reason it did not work to use the raw x values from .emsa when fitting, while using channels as int worked.
  - Also fitting is slower / worse with non-normalized values.
    - Might be because it is easier to guess correct a, peak, and std with normalized values
